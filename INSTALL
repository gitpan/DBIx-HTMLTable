DBIx::HTMLTable Installation

Please remember that this software has not been tested thoroughly,
only on Solaris with an Apache version 1.3.19 server.  Refer all 
questions and problem reports to the author, rkiesling@mainmatter.com.


System requirements:

1.  A Unix or derivative operating system.
2.  Perl version 5.004 or greater.
3.  Perl DBI and DBD modules for your database server.
4.  Apache with mod_cgi and Perl CGI.pm
5.  GNU make.


Installation:

1.  Unpack the archive, substitute the actual version in the 
    commands:

    $ tar zxvf DBIx-HTMLTable-<version>.tar.gz   # GNU Tar

    $ gunzip -c DBIx-HTMLTable-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -  # Standard tar

2.  Change to the top-level subdirectory:

    $ cd DBIx-HTMLTable-<version>

3.  The top-level Makefile should work on any Unix or derivative
    system.  It uses the host system's Perl installation to 
    build the package Makefiles.  At the prompt, type:

    $ perl Makefile.PL

4.  Build the program modules and documentation.  Type:

    $ make

5.  If necessary, become root (via "su", for example), and 
    install the source files and documentation in the system's 
    site_perl library, and the "browser" script in 
    /usr/local/bin, using the "make install" command:

  $ su
  Enter Password:
  # make install
