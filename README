DBIx::HTMLTable Installation

System Requirements

1.  A Unix or derivative operating system.
2.  Perl version 5.004 or greater.
3.  Perl DBI and the DBD module for your database server.
4.  Apache with mod_cgi and Perl CGI.pm
5.  GNU make.


Installation

1.  Unpack the archive, substitute the actual version in the 
    commands:

    $ tar zxvf DBIx-HTMLTable-<version>.tar.gz   # GNU Tar

    $ gunzip -c DBIx-HTMLTable-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -  # Standard tar

2.  Change to the top-level subdirectory:

    $ cd DBIx-HTMLTable-<version>

3.  The top-level Makefile should work on any Unix or derivative
    system.  It uses the host system's Perl installation to 
    build the package Makefiles.  At the prompt, type:

    $ perl Makefile.PL

4.  Build the program modules and documentation.  Type:

    $ make

5.  Become root and install the source files and documentation 
    in the system's site_perl library.

    $ su
    Enter Password:
    # make install
